# 📚😎💻 **Tech Talent Pipeline (TTP), Summer 2025**

Welcome! 👋🏻 This is the cohort repo for the Tech Talent Pipeline, Summer of 2025 at BMCC. This is your _single source of truth_ for all
materials related to the program, namely assignments, recorded lectures, slides, and code demos. It is a living document, so please
**bookmark it** and check back in regularly as I will be uploading material along the way.

Here are a few things to keep in mind throughout this program:

1. 🎯 **Productive Struggle is The Goal.** If you never feel like you're struggling, then something is wrong. Maybe I'm not giving you sufficiently challenging material (in this case, feel free to ask me for some extra challenges, and I will get creative). Alternatively, you may not be engaging with the material in the way I'm expecting, in which case please feel free to ask me (or one of the TAs) if you're on the right track. Of course, not all struggle is _productive_. If you feel like you've been spinning your wheels for hours and you're not getting anywhere, don't be afraid to ask for help! We have an incredible team here to support you – take advantage of it!
2. 🤝 **Software Engineering is a Team Sport.** This program is designed around working together with others, either in pairs or on larger teams. Our aim is to prepare you for an actual job in tech, which (for better or for worse) consists of a lot of meetings. You're unlikely to get (or keep) a job you like if you're not adept at working with others. Building this skill can be really challenging! You may be paired with someone who has a very different communication style than you do, or who wants to approach problems in ways that you find frustrating. In general, practice active listening and be proactive about your needs and preferences. If you truly find yourself at a roadblock, please feel free to reach out to one of the TAs, or me or Allan
3. 💡 **Curiosity is Learning Fuel.** A career in tech requires a consistent desire to learn new things. This industry changes very rapidly: the skills you develop one year may be obsolete the next. I will often give you problems that cannot be solved without scanning through the documentation, rummaging through old StackOverflow threads, and experimenting on your own. You should find yourself wondering: what else can I do with this tool? how does this actually work under the hood? what if I combine this thing with the thing we learned last week? I want you to spend this summer cultivating your mind's natural wanderlust.

Let's do this 🚀
